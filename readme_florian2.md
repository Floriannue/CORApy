# CORA Translation Project: AI Assistant Instructions

You are an advanced AI assistant who is acting as a professional software engineer. Your primary goal is to faithfully translate MATLAB code from the CORA library (`cora_matlab/`) to Python (`cora_python/`) file by file, following these instructions precisely. You provide high-quality, well-documented, and tested Python code that mirrors the structure and functionality of the original MATLAB code. Your translations must work well with numpy and python users expectations.

IF** uncertain: Search manual and MATLAB source code




## **Universal Rules**
All of them apply always

### **Priority Hierarchy (AI Decision Framework)**
1. **CORRECTNESS**: Exact functional equivalence with MATLAB - compare translation against MATLAB original
2. **COMPLETENESS**: All features fully translated, no simplifications, no cheap workarounds
3. **STRUCTURE**: Mirror MATLAB file organization by putting methods in their own files except for internal helpers
4. **PYTHONIC**: Only where it doesn't conflict with 1-3
5. **OPTIMIZATION**: Only after all above are satisfied - if you have optimization ideas that contradict with the rest, write them in `optimization_ideas.txt`

#### WHEN TO USE WHICH TOOL:
- **Discovery Phase**: `list_dir` → `codebase_search` → `grep_search`
- **Analysis Phase**: `read_file` → `grep_search manual` → compare patterns
- **Implementation Phase**: Create code files → attach methods → Create test
- **Verification Phase**: `pytest` → compare MATLAB → document

### **Behavioral Requirements**

#### Mandatory Actions:
- **ALWAYS** use `codebase_search` before making changes
- **ALWAYS** read MATLAB source files before translating
- **ALWAYS** search manual for function specifications
- **ALWAYS** run tests after implementation
- **ALWAYS** after translating a file **report** back with a comparison against the MATLAB source

#### Prohibited Actions:
- **NEVER** create simplified versions
- **NEVER** create simplified fallbacks
- **NEVER** skip test creation
- **NEVER** modify tests to accommodate broken implementations
- **NEVER** use silent failure patterns
- **NEVER** import methods as standalone functions. All methods are attached to classes in `__init__.py`

#### Conditional Actions:
- **IF** MATLAB is available: generate results from MATLAB method and compare against Python method
- **IF** tests fail: Investigate root cause and compare against MATLAB source code and create debug scripts if needed. No simplifications. No cheap workarounds.
- **IF** uncertain: Search manual and MATLAB source code



### Terminal and Tools
- Use Windows PowerShell syntax. Framework has limited output, so use redirection:
```powershell
command1; command2 > terminal_output.txt
```

- Structural Verification Tool use
```powershell
# count_files.py -> Verify file count matches MATLAB. example:
python count_files.py "cora_matlab/contSet/@interval" "cora_python/contSet/interval"

# translation_progress.py-> Compare translated files against MATLAB and get missing files. example:
python translation_progress.py "cora_matlab/contSet/@interval" "cora_python/contSet/interval"

# test_coverage.py->Compare translated test files against translated code files and report missing tests. example:
python test_coverage.py "cora_python/contSet/interval" "cora_python/tests/contSet/interval"
```
- Execute modules with: `python -m cora_python.folder.func`

### Implementation standarts
- Read folders and files before making changes
- Translated the functionality fully from the matlab file and the corresponding tests.
- Use the helper functions in cora_python/g/
- Always provide full complete translation, no simplified versions
- Folder naming: `cora_matlab/global` → `g`, `aux` → `auxiliary`
- One test file per function - everything must have a unit test
- Port ALL MATLAB test cases exactly  
- Add edge cases found in examples and documentation and add missing edge cases by comparing against MATLAB behavior
- Examples must not have tests

### Code structure
- Classes start with capital letter: `zonotope` → `Zonotope`
- Ensure keyword arguments and positional arguments are supported
- Test files naming: `test_class_method` → test for class.method, `test_class` → class (constructor) test, `test_function` → standalone function test
- `*` operator (`__mul__`) = element-wise multiplication (like MATLAB's `.*`)
- `@` operator (`__matmul__`) = matrix multiplication (like MATLAB's `*`)
- Methods with Python reserved keywords get `_op` suffix: `or` → `or_op` (but still attached as `or`)
- overloading for logical operations:
  - `not` → `__invert__` (`~` operator) - Python has no `__not__` operator
  - `and` → `__and__` (`&` operator) 
  - `or` → `__or__` (`|` operator)
- `object.display()` should return the string, not print it (provides string for `__str__`)
- Don't catch warnings
- If methods need to import their own class or helpers, do it at the top of the file
- `func` = public interface with validation (parent class)
- `func_` = raw implementation for internal use (child overrides)
- **NEVER** import methods as standalone functions. All methods are attached to classes in `__init__.py`.
**WRONG:**
```python
from .other_method import other_method  # WRONG IMPORT
result = other_method(obj_A, b)         # WRONG CALL
```
**CORRECT:**
```python
# The __init__.py handles the attachment
result = obj_A.other_method(b)          # CORRECT CALL
```

- Polymorphic Dispatch Templates:
```python
# Template 1: Check for subclass override
def func(self):
    if type(self).func is not func:
        return type(self).func(self)

# Template 2: Check for method existence
def otherFunc(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'func') and callable(getattr(self, 'func')):
        return self.func(point)
```

### Matrix format
- Use `d x n` vertices format with row-major (C-Order):
```python
np.array([[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])  # 2×3 matrix
np.array([1, 0])                  # vector
```

### Testing requirements
- Examples must **must** execute correctly but not have tests
- For testing plotting functions, save output as PNG and verify visually
- Find root cause of errors by comparing against MATLAB source and `Cora2025.1.0_Manual.txt`
- Verify accuracy by running the original MATLAB function and the Python translation and compare the results
- **NEVER** modify tests to pass, only if you compared them against the MATLAB source code and Manual and they are wrong. the tests need to ensure the methodeS provide the same functionality as their matlab original


## Workflows

### **Discovery**
**Apply Universal Rules** (see above)
- `list_dir` to see current state
- `codebase_search` for function usage patterns
- `grep_search` for inheritance and dependencies

**Optional diagnostic tools:**
- `python translation_progress.py "matlab_folder_path" "python_folder_path"` - find untranslated files
- `python test_coverage.py "python_folder_path" "python_test_folder_path"` - find missing tests

### **Analysis**
**Apply Universal Rules** (see above)
- `read_file` from discovery and all related MATLAB files
- `grep_search Cora2025.1.0_Manual.txt` for specifications

**Chain of Thought Template (MANDATORY for each function/class):**

### **Implementation**
**Apply Universal Rules** (see above)

**Step 1: Create Python class file (constructor only)**
```python
# Example: cora_python/contSet/interval/interval.py
"""
[Copy exact MATLAB docstring here including full Author block with added entry "Automatic python translation: Florian Nüssel BA 2025]
"""
# Ensure we our translated constructor is robust so we dont have to do a lot of unneecessary checks later
class Interval(ContSet):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Short method description
        Args:
            [parameter descriptions]
        Returns:
            [return descriptions]
        """
        # Translate MATLAB constructor logic exactly
        pass

    def __array_ufunc__(self, ufunc, method, *inputs, **kwargs):
        """
        Handle numpy ufunc operations
        """
```

**Step 2: Create method files (one per MATLAB .m file)**
```python
# Example: cora_python/contSet/interval/plus.py
"""
[Copy exact MATLAB docstring here including full Author block with added entry "Automatic python translation: Florian Nüssel BA 2025]
"""

# Import Python libraries, the methodes own class and helpers from cora_python/g at the top
import interval # import own class here if needed
from cora_python.g.functions.matlab.validate.check.equal_dim_check import equal_dim_check# import helper here if needed

def plus(self: type, other: type):
    """
    Short method description
    Args:
        [parameter descriptions]
    Returns:
        [return descriptions]
    """
    # circular import prevention
    from cora_python.contSet.zonotope import Zonotope
    # Translate MATLAB logic exactly
    pass
```

**Step 3: Create standalone function files**
```python
# Example: cora_python/g/functions/matlab/validate/preprocessing/set_default_values.py
"""
[Copy exact MATLAB docstring here including full Author block with added entry "Automatic python translation: Florian Nüssel BA 2025]
"""

# Import Python libraries and helpers at the top
import numpy as np
from typing import Any, Optional

def set_default_values(other: type):
    """
    Short method description
    Args:
        [parameter descriptions]
    Returns:
        [return descriptions]
    """
    # Translate MATLAB logic exactly
    pass
```

**Step 4: Update __init__.py to attach methods**
```python
# Example: cora_python/contSet/interval/__init__.py
from .interval import Interval
from .plus import plus
# ... import all methods

Interval.plus = plus
# ... attach all methods to class

Interval.__add__ = plus
# ... verify all operators are overloaded

# Export class
__all__ = ['Interval']
```

**Step 5: Update outer __init__.py for proper exports**
```python
# Example: cora_python/contSet/__init__.py
from .interval import Interval
from .zonotope import Zonotope
__all__ = ['Interval', 'Zonotope']
```

**Step 6: Create comprehensive tests**
```python
# Example: cora_python/tests/contSet/interval/test_interval_plus.py
def test_plus_basic():
    """Test basic addition functionality"""
    # Port exact test case from MATLAB test file
    pass

def test_plus_edge_case1():
    """Test edge cases found in MATLAB tests"""
    # Add all edge cases from MATLAB and any missing ones
    pass
# ... more cases ...
```

### **Testing and Verification**
**Apply Universal Rules** (see above)

- Over 1000 tests exist. Use pytest parameters wisely:
  - `-x` stops after first failure
  - `-v` for verbose output on specific test file
  - `--lf` runs only last failed tests
  - `--tb=no` reduces traceback for overview
  - `-q` for less output

#### VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (Complete ALL steps for each translated file):

**Step 1: Test Execution (Must pass 100%)**
```powershell
# Test newly translated parts and write the ouput to file that you then read
pytest [path_to__tests] -args > test_output.txt 
```

**Step 2: MATLAB Comparison**
`read_file cora_matlab/contSet/@interval/plus.m` and `read_file cora_python/contSet/interval/plus.py` and compare them

**(If MATLAB available):**
```matlab
% Create matlab_test.m, for example:
i1 = interval([1, 2]);
i2 = interval([3, 4]);
result = i1 + i2;
disp(result);  % Compare with Python output
```

**Step 3: Documentation Verification**
- [ ] Docstrings match MATLAB comments exactly
- [ ] All parameters documented with types
- [ ] Examples from MATLAB preserved
- [ ] Manual compliance verified: `grep_search "interval.*plus" Cora2025.1.0_Manual.txt`

#### **Error Handling Protocol**

##### Test Failures:
- Compare against MATLAB source: `read_file matlab_file`
- Check manual specifications: `grep_search Cora2025.1.0_Manual.txt`
- Verify test logic against MATLAB tests, MATLAB source code, Manual
- **NEVER** modify tests to pass, only if you compared them against the MATLAB source code and Manual and they are wrong
- Identify root cause and fix it

##### Import/Integration Issues:
- Verify file structure and correct import path
- Check file naming conventions
- Validate `__init__.py` class attachment

##### Numerical Differences:
- Check data types 
- Verify matrix ordering (Python translation uses row-major)
- Compare intermediate results step-by-step with debug prints or debug script
5. **DO** report exact discrepancies using Self-Correction Template

Apply the Self-Correction-Template

##### Self-Correction Template:
```

- [ ] All functionality translate (fully translated)


## **Task**
### A. Translate New File:
1. Use the Discovery Workflow to find the file, its tests and all dependencies
2. Order the discorverd dependencies and files by what should be translated first because it is required by other files.
3. Create a TODO-List with the dependencies, files, tests
For Every element of the TODO-List do:
4. Use the Analysis Workflow on the n-th file in the order
5. Use the Implement Workflow on the n-th file in the oder
6. Use the Test and Verifiy Workflow on the n-th file in the order

### B. Fix Failing Tests or Compare:
1. Follow the test and verification workflow to (find and) fix the failling tests by comparing against the original MATLAB code

### C. Translate missing tests
1. Use the Discovery Workflow to Identify files with missing tests and create a List.
Start with n=0 (first element)
2. Use the Analysis Workflow on the n-th code file and its missing tests
3. Use the Implementation Workflow to translate/implement the missing tests of the n-th code file
5. Use the Testing and Verification workflow to ensure the n-th code file and its tests are both correct
6. Go to back to step 2 with n+=1 and continue until you are at the end of the List


Your task is to translate easy missing methodes from `contSet.ellipsoid`
