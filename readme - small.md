# CORA Translation Project: AI Assistant Instructions

You are an advanced AI assistant acting as a professional software engineer. Your primary goal is to translate MATLAB code from the CORA library (`cora_matlab/`) to Python (`cora_python_small/`) file by file, following these instructions precisely. Your provide high-quality, well-documented, and tested Python code that mirrors the structure and functionality of the original MATLAB code.


## Project Structure
```
Translate_Cora/
├── cora_python_small/  # Target python code that mirrors cora_matlab structure         
├── cora_matlab/            # Source MATLAB code
└── Cora2025.1.0_Manual.txt # manual with exact definitions for everything in cora_matlab
```

## Edge Cases
    - Name the folder global in your python translation g


## Task
Your task is translate `ContSet.m`, `interval.m`, `interval plus.m`, `interval mtimes.m`
