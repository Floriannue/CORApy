projectHighDim_ - lifts an empty set onto a higher-dimensional space

Syntax:
   O = projectHighDim_(O,N,dims)

Inputs:
   O - emptySet object
   N - dimension of the higher-dimensional space
   proj - states of the high-dimensional space that correspond to the
         states of the low-dimensional space

Outputs:
   O - lifted emptySet object

Example: 
   O = emptySet(4);
   projectHighDim(O,6,[1,2,5,6])

Other m-files required: none
Subfunctions: none
MAT-files required: none
