    isApproxSymmetric - Checks if a shape matrix is symmetric (within
    tolerance)

    Syntax:
        res = isApproxSymmetric(Q,TOL)

    Inputs:
        Q - square matrix
        TOL - tolerance

    Outputs:
        res - true/false indicating whether Q is symmetric (within tolerance)

    Example: 
        # E = ellipsoid([1,0;0,1/2],[1;1]);
        # res = isApproxSymmetric(E.Q,E.TOL);

    # In numpy, we can achieve this with np.triu and np.tril and then transposing.
    # However, for symmetry check, a simpler approach is to directly compare Q with its transpose.
