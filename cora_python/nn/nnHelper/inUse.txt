nnHelper Methods Currently in Use in Python Translation
====================================================

ACTUALLY INTEGRATED METHODS (5/25):
1. validateNNoptions - Core validation throughout neural network operations
2. leastSquarePolyFunc - Used in activation layers for polynomial approximation
3. leastSquareRidgePolyFunc - Used in activation layers for ridge regression
4. minMaxDiffOrder - Used in activation layers for difference computation
5. conversionConZonoStarSet - Used in neural network evaluation
6. conversionStarSetConZono - Used in neural network evaluation


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Integrate polynomial operations into neural network layers
2. Integrate polynomial zonotope operations into evaluation methods
3. Integrate order index computations into layer operations
4. Integrate heap operations into polynomial zonotope evaluation
5. Integrate derivative methods into activation layer computations

This analysis shows that while all nnHelper methods are translated and tested, only a small subset (5/25) are actually integrated into the Python neural network operations.
