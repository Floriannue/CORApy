"""
minMaxDiffOrder - compute the maximum and the minimum difference between the activation
function and a polynomial fit

Syntax:
    [diffl,diffu] = nnHelper.minMaxDiffOrder(coeffs, l, u, f, der1)

Inputs:
    coeffs - coefficients of polynomial
    l - lower bound of input domain
    u - upper bound of input domain
    f - function handle of activation function
    der1 - bounds for derivative of activation functions

Outputs:
    [diffl,diffu] - interval bounding the lower and upper error

Other m-files required: none
Subfunctions: none
MAT-files required: none
