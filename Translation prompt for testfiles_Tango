Step 1: Read file structure
You are assisting me in converting a MATLAB toolbox into Python.
**Root Path for matlab toolbox:**
D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\CORA-master

## Current Task:
Please understand the original MATLAB file structure for the testing files of one specific class:
**Path**
D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\CORA-master\unitTests\contSet\{contSet_name} (e.g., contSet, zonotope, etc.)
The Target Class {contSet_name} is externally specified

Save/update the structured tree view of the Class in directory: `PyCora\Instructions for translation\Translation_for_test_contSet_class`, name "test_{contSet_name}_structure.json" as follows:
  {
    "method_name": "XXX",
    "matlab_path": "D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\CORA-master\unitTests\contSet\{contSet_name}\test_{contSet_name}_{method_name}.m",
    "python_path": "D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\PyCora\unitTests\contSet\{contSet_name}\test_{contSet_name}_{method_name}.py",
    "status": "done",
    "notes": "XXX"
  },
    {
    "method_name": "XXX",
    "matlab_path": "D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\CORA-master\unitTests\contSet\{contSet_name}\test_{contSet_name}_{method_name}.m",
    "python_path": "D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\PyCora\unitTests\contSet\{contSet_name}\test_{contSet_name}_{method_name}.py",
    "status": "pending",
    "notes": "XXX"
  },
The value of "status" is obtained by comparing the files in "matlab_path" and "python_path".

Step 2: Translate and correct
You are assisting me in converting a MATLAB toolbox to Python.
**Root Path for matlab toolbox:**
D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\CORA-master

## Current Task: 
Read "test_{class_name}_structure.json"
Choose one test file for methods of {class_name} with status "pending". For this python test file test_{contSet_name}_{method_name}.py:
- Compare the content of the file with matlab to ensure consistency
- run the test_{contSet_name}_{method_name}.py
- If there are errors, correct them
Note that:
- When translating or modifying a method, always first check how it is organized in the original MATLAB codebase.
In particular, consider whether it is defined in a separate file, as part of a class, or in a specific module.
The translated Python implementation should reflect this structure as much as possible, to preserve consistency and modularity across the toolbox.
- When translating import paths, please note:
The current Python working directory is the PyCora/ folder itself.
Therefore, PyCora is not recognized as a package by Python and should NOT be used as an import prefix.
Instead, import modules starting directly from the subfolders inside PyCora.
- The file name test_{contSet_name}_{method_name} means to test the {method_name} of the {contSet_name}
- The method of the class can be found in "D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\PyCora\contSet\contSet"

Step 3: Check points for correction
You are assisting me in converting a MATLAB toolbox to Python.
**Root Path for matlab toolbox:**
D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\CORA-master
**Root Path for python toolbox:**
D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\PyCora

## Current Task: 
Correct the test_{contSet_name}_{method_name}.py according to the following notes:
- When translating or modifying a method, always first check how it is organized in the original MATLAB codebase.
In particular, consider whether it is defined in a separate file, as part of a class, or in a specific module.
The translated Python implementation should reflect this structure as much as possible, to preserve consistency and modularity across the toolbox.
- Compare the method and test file with the original MATLAB source file and check if the structure, logic, and parameters are consistent. Ensure that the core functionality is correctly translated.
- When translating import paths, please note:
The current Python working directory is the PyCora/ folder itself.
Therefore, PyCora is not recognized as a package by Python and should NOT be used as an import prefix.
Instead, import modules starting directly from the subfolders inside PyCora.
- The file name test_{contSet_name}_{method_name} means to test the {method_name} of the {contSet_name}
- The method of the class can be found in "D:\Software\MATLAB\R2018b\toolbox\CORA-master\PyCora\contSet\{contSet_name}\{method_name}"
